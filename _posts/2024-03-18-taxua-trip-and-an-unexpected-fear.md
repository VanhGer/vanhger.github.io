Hi there! It's me again. I've just finished my trip to Ta Xua for one week, and a lot of feelings are still
here with me rightnow. So, I think it's great to write some down.

Well, Ta Xua is located in the landscape of the Bac Yen district in Son La province. It offers an enchanting blend
of untouched nature and a sense of tranquility that is rare to find in popular.

I went there with my group of friends, and we stayed there for 2 days, renting motobikes to travel around. Unfortunately, the weather on the first day wasn't too supportive. It was cloudy and foggy, with temperatures around 20 degrees Celsius, so persionally, I found it hard to go by motobike. However, on the second day, it was sunny and windy, and of course, we enjoyed many beautiful moments that day. Here are some pictures Ta Xua and us:

It was fun, right? But look at the blog title... Yeah you see, I experienced a pretty terrible fear. 

There is one thing you shoud know about Ta Xua: it is situated on the mountain, so in order to travel around its tourist destinations, we must drive downhill and uphill many times. The road, therefore, is narrow and dangerous, so we had to drive very carefully. I think it's the trade-off to admire the magnificient scenery. And do you remember what I said in the first day? It was foggy and cloudy. So, when my friend and I were driving downhill, we had an accident. We spun around, fell to the ground, and narrowly avoided being crashed into by the car behind. God blessed us; we were still fine after that and continued driving to the homestay.

But is that done? Not yet, at least not to me. For the rest of the day and the next day, I felt affaid of going downhill, and everytime I was on the motobike, I remembered that terrible moment. My hands were shaking when holding the handlebars, and even going uphill I had a hard time. So, on the first night there, I knew that I shouldn't travel anymore, because I was scared of going downhill, scared of... death. 

Then, on the second day, I saw that the weather is better, no more fog, and the sun rising made me feel better. Also, our team have only 4 boys, if I didn't drive,the other girls would have to and it would have been a worse situation. So, with no choice, I continued drive. And well, at the end of that trip, I drove carefully and didn't have any accidents. Thanks God.

That story showed me that when I experience a new fear, I also experienced some physiscal reactions like fast breath, shaking hand,... which I thought only happened in the movie. Man proposes God deposes, I had a chance to feel that and that changed my mind a little bit, hihi. 

To end this post, I will share with you some pictures from my memorable trip that my friends captured: [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@chiichii.03/photo/7342578503658786050).
