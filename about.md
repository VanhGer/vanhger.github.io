# About me
Hi Im Vanhg.
My real name is Viet Anh. I'm a third-year student at [VNU-UET](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn). My major is Information Technology.

I'm just a curious guy who wants to explore the world. I may make it or I may fail, but trust me, I will keep going till the end.

Some facts:
- I'm addicted to Blockchain and ZKP.
- I love music.
- I like little pretty things.
