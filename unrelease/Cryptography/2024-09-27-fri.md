In Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) field, **commitment scheme** is one of the most important parts. There are 2 parties take part in this, a **committer** and a **verifier**. The committer want to bind itself to a message $m$ without revealing the message to the verifier via a commitment (binding and hiding). Then the verifier can verify the message by "opening" to the commitment to any value. In the case of cryptography, the message $m$ is often considered as a polynomial.

Currently, one of the most popular commitment scheme protocol in ZKP is FRI. The acronym FRI stands for Fast Reed-Solomon IOP of Proximity. This protocol is used to establish that a polynomial has a bounded degree. Before we dive into the inner work of FRI, let's take a look at some math theories relatives to it.

## Fundamental theorem of Algebra

A fact in Algebra is that any nonzero polynomial of degree at most $n$ over any field has at most $n$ roots. 

For example, 2-degree polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2$ has $2$ roots: $x = -1$ and $x = -2$. 
This fact is leveraged to imply the following:

> For any two distinct (unequal) polynomial $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ of degree at most $n$, $f(x) = g(x)$ for at most $n$ values of $x$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$.

**Proof**: 
We have $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Because the degree of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is at most $n$, the degree of $h(x)$ is also at most $n$. Then, $h(x)$ has at most $n$ roots, i.e, $h(x) = f(x) - g(x) = 0$ for at most $n$ values  $\iff$ $f(x) = g(x)$ at most $n$ values.

Now, we can use this theory to convince $2$  $n$-degree polynomials $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ are the same or not. We pick a random number $z \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and compute $F(z)$ and $G(z)$. If $F(z) = G(z)$ then we can establish that 2 polynomials are the same, with the probability is:
$P =1 -  \dfrac{n}{p}$.  This probability is nearly to $1$ because $n \ll p$ .


## Merkle Tree

FRI ultilizes Merkle tree to commit to a vector. Each leaf of the tree represents an entry in the vector, the inner node is the hash of the 2 children nodes, and the root serving as the commitment of all the vector.

The workflow of Merkle Tree protocol is the following:

The committer sends the root for the verifier. Then the verifier checks the valid of the commitment by choosing a random position in the vector and ask the committer to send the corresponding value and proof.

For example, if the verifier choose position $2$ (the red one). Then the committer send its value ( $= K$) and the proof (the yellow nodes).
With that proof, the verifier can compute the root again, and check with the given commitment from the committer.

## Root of Unity

Let $w \in \mathbb{F}_p$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity. That is, $n$ is the smallest integer such that $w^n = 1$. The "multiplicative subgroup" of $F_q$ is: $\Omega = \lbrace 1, w, w^2,..., w^{n-1} \rbrace$.
An attribute of root of unity that usable in FRI is that: if $x$ is the $n$ root of unity then  $x^2$ is the $n/2$ root of unity.

## FRI

> Now you have enough knowledge for understanding FRI. 

The idea of FRI is the iteratively "folding" the polynomial into smaller (often by half of the degree). So if the polynomial has the degree $\le k$ then we need to do "folding" for $log_2(len(m))$. 

Given the polynomial $f(x)$, the committer convinces that the degree of $f(x)$ is $\le n$. To do that, we first evaluate $f(x)$ in the multiplicative subgroup of size $n$: $\Omega = \lbrace 1, w, w^2,..., w^{n-1} \rbrace$.
